# Neural Network training, constraint solving and sudoku to connect the two.
Notebooks for a practical session on training a digit classifier and using it to solve visual sudoku's

p0: to help you test that all necessary software is installed
p1: first part, training an mnist digit recognizer, predicting and solving a sudoku grid
p2: second part, predicting the grid probabilities and solving a maximum-likelihood visual sudoku

## Installation instructions:
if (you do not have 'conda' or 'pip' on your machine):
    install miniconda as per https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
if (yo do not have 'classic Jupyter Notebook' on your machine):
    'conda install -c conda-forge notebook', see https://jupyter.org/install
download the p0 file to a folder, run 'jupyter notebook' in that folder, open p0, read it and test...
